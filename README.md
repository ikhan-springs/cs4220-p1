# CS 4220 Project 1

This repository contains my work for Project 1 for the course CS 4220: Computer Networks.

CS 4220 focuses on the basic network and protocol concepts and principles with practical hands-on exercises on network management, network programming, and network planning through the use of industry simulators. Topics include internet protocols and routing, local area networks, basic TCP/IP programming, congestion control, packet switching and routing, quality-of-service, and network management.

I completed this course at UCCS in May 2021. A brief description of the outcome of each project is given below. A more detailed description can be found at the top of each program file.

CRC.c converts an incoming bit stream into a frame using CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check).

Hamming-1.c converts an incoming bit stream into a frame using Hamming code.

Hamming-2.c shows how Hamming code can be used to correct single-bit errors.
